# Generative Art Gallery

## Overview
This project is a web-based generative art gallery that allows users to experience a range of dynamically generated art styles.

Users can cycle through different generative algorithms, view the resulting artwork, and download their favorite pieces.

## Features
- **Multiple Art Styles**: Includes several generative art algorithms, each producing a distinct visual pattern.
- **Interactive Experience**: Users can shuffle through various art styles and initiate the generation of new patterns.
